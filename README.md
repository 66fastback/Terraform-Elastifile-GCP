- DISK_TYPE = local, ssd, or hdd. Only applies to custom templates
- DISK_CONFIG = [disks per vm]_[disk size in GB] example: "8_375" will create 8, 375GB disks. Only applies to custom templates
- VM_CONFIG = [cpu cores per vm]_[ram per vm] example "20_128" will create 20 CPU, 128GB RAM VMs. Default: "4_42" Only applies to custom templates
- CLUSTER_NAME = Name for ECFS service
- ZONE = Zone
- PROJECT = Project name
- NETWORK = VPC to use
